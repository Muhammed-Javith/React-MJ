Firebase:
  - firebase is a real time database where we are going to save all of our data
    that's inside our redux store.
  - thatway whenever we add a post or remove a post, the state of our application
    will persist inside of the database.
  - that way, whenever we rerun the app, our data is the same as what it was before.
    we don't lose it.
  - it will fetch all from our database.
